### Quick Start

1. **Download this repository**
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/tboy1337/Foundry-Manager-Windows.git
   cd Foundry-Manager-Windows
   ```

2. **Run the installer**
   ```cmd
   install_foundry.cmd
   ```

   - Download and extract Foundry
   - Install all components (forge, cast, anvil, chisel)
   - Update your PATH

4. **Restart your terminal**
   - Close and reopen your terminal/IDE to use Foundry commands

## Usage

### Installing/Updating Foundry

Simply run the installation script whenever you want to install or update Foundry:

```cmd
install_foundry.cmd
```

The script will:
- Check if you have Foundry installed
- Compare your version with the latest available
- Automatically upgrade if a newer version is available
- Skip installation if you're already up to date

### Verifying Installation

After installation, verify Foundry is working:

```cmd
forge --version
cast --version
anvil --version
chisel --version
```

## Uninstall

To completely remove Foundry from your system:

1. **Run the uninstaller**
   ```cmd
   uninstall_foundry.cmd
   ```

2. **Confirm removal**
   - The script will display your current version
   - Type `Y` to confirm uninstallation

3. **Restart your terminal**
   - Close and reopen your terminal/IDE to apply PATH changes

The uninstaller will:
- Terminate any running Foundry processes
- Remove all Foundry executables
- Clean up the installation directory
- Remove Foundry from your PATH

## Installation Directory

Foundry is installed to:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Foundry\bin
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "curl is not installed or in PATH"

**Solution**: Ensure you're running Windows 10 version 1803 or later. If curl is missing, download and install it from [curl.se](https://curl.se/windows/).

#### "Failed to download Foundry"

**Possible causes:**
- Network connectivity issues
- GitHub is temporarily unavailable
- Firewall/antivirus blocking the download

**Solution**: Check your internet connection and try again. You may need to temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus.

#### Commands not recognized after installation

**Solution**: Restart your terminal or IDE. If the issue persists, manually verify that `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Foundry\bin` is in your PATH:

```powershell
$env:Path -split ';' | Select-String "Foundry"
```

## What Gets Installed

The installer downloads and installs these Foundry components:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **forge** | Build, test, fuzz, debug, and deploy Solidity contracts |
| **cast** | Perform Ethereum RPC calls from the command line |
| **anvil** | Local Ethereum node for development and testing |
| **chisel** | Solidity REPL for quick testing and debugging |

## How It Works

### Key Safety Features

1. **Backup Before Upgrade** - Your current installation is backed up before any changes
2. **Integrity Checks** - Downloaded files are verified before extraction
3. **Safe Failure** - All errors are caught and handled gracefully
